* changed
b bugfix


1.4.0       in progress
              * docs: User manual expanded and updated.
              * Stats system can handle several optimization runs.
                Interrupted runs can be continued automatically.
              * Gradient system simplified. Added gradients using a truncated Taylor series
                with scaling and squaring, and the auxiliary matrix technique.

              * Implemented various recommendations from Nocedal-Wright.
              + utils/bfgs: Native implementation of the BFGS optimization algorithm.
              + utils/apply_options: MATLAB-style options processing.
              + dynamo/plot_pop, dynamo/plot_eig, dynamo/plot_stats: New plotting functions.
              + dynamo/shake: Randomly perturbs the control sequence, can be used to get out of local optima.
              + dynamo/split: Refines the control sequence by splitting given bins into several.
              + test: Unit tests for DYNAMO.
              + test_rand_problem: Generates random optimization problems for testing/benchmarking purposes.
              + test_benchmark: Measures the walltime required to compute different errors and gradients.
              + examples/demo_coop_gates
              b Always returns the reason why the optimization ended.
              b dynamo/gradient_setup: gradient_g_mixed_exact provided with wrong *_needed_now.
              b dynamo/gradient_g_mixed_exact: gradient with respect to tau was wrong.
              b qsystem.B_is_Hamiltonian was not set up properly, resulting in a spurious warning.
