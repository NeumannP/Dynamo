REACHABILITY:


2012-06-28
-Unitary state transfer: can noise provide a shortcut?
-Limited U-controllability: can noise extend the reachable set? yes,
 consider 1q with z rotations and ampdamp noise. more?
-Theorem 1 with noise that cannot be fully switched off?
-infinitesimal evolutions with bitflip => majorization?
 This would mean that the reachable set in Th. 2 is maximal, and would
 immediately yield \Delta P <= 0.


18.4.2012
test_gradient generalized, expected results for gradient_g* funcs as
well as 



16.4.2012
-Model system: two qubits, zz interaction, local xy controls on both (fully controllable). Markovian noise.
-purity monotonically decreases <=> noise is unital
-2q, const unital noise on A, controllable ampdamp on B, random state
 transfer, can B counteract A?

ini, fin = rand_pos(4), A = dephasing, increase purity: yes, to very small error, ampdamp clearly needed, no success without.
A = isotropic depolarization seems to be much harder but still works to some extent




12.4.2012
-three qubits, linear chain, zz interaction, noise on C:
- unitary orbit test:




3.4.2012
-purity change test with coherent transfer/swap:
ini = rand_pos(2) * I
fin = rand_pos(2) * I

dephasing or depolarizing noise on B: (unital!)
purity decreases: ok, noise pulses lower purity as expected
purity increases: nope, also noise levels always minimized (purely detrimental)

ampdamp noise on B:
purity decreases: ok, noise pulses can lower purity
purity increases: usually ok, sometimes tough optimization as noise
is first almost made to vanish and finally reintroduced


-unitary orbit: constant purity, can be done without noise, but can noise be useful?
ini = rand_pos(4)
fin = SU(4) rotation of ini
T = 8

ampdamp noise on B: sometimes used
dephasing on B: almost never used
depolarization on B: practically never used







- try to find nontrivial, useful noise controls.
  state transfer to |0>, controllable damping, noncontrollable
  depolarization

Muschik entanglement generation


14.2.2012
- there is no Hamiltonian that commutes with Muschik kappa>>1 FP but
  not with the corresponding quasi-FP. Reason: their non-identity components are
  proportional to one another.


9.11.2011

-Freedom/nonuniqueness in choosing Lindblad generators
-Go for a triplet state FP. Effect of different H:s, form of L gens.
-Can one get a nonlocal fixed point using linear combinations of local
 ops as L generators? In the Muschik system yes, in 2q?
-Construct the most general local Lindblad gens (+non-unital...)
-FP:s as a control problem: noise controls, state transfer from random
 initial states to FP, average over many initial states.


-existence of local minima in open systems? lots.


Given a drift H, what limitations does it place on the potential fixed
point set we obtain by engineering Lindblad ops? What if we require a
completely pure fixed point?



Lindblad FP code:
try to generate systems where exp(t*L) has strong transient polynomial
behavior, i.e. L is not diagonalizable. Jordan vs. Schur decomposition?


two qubits: Muschik system

using coherent control to manipulate fixed points.
keeping away from the attractor as long as possible using control
shifting the fixed point
speeding up the convergence to the FP


block-diagonal H -> L?



qubit, z drift, very strong x control, depolarizing noise,
controllable relaxation to zero: reachable set given initial state?
fixed points? target just outside reachable set, set of optimal points
(for different initial states)

2012-01-30:
- Replicated Plenio's FMO results (with small relative errors...)
- overdamping the coherent oscillations with dephasing seems to be the key


2012-01-19:
Plenio_Huelga_2008
Fig. 3: 3 spin chain, variable dephasing on site 2, numerically optimal result
is slightly different from constant \gamma = 2.8.

Fig 2:, \omega_2 = 1.6, difference is much more pronounced...? or is it?

Both cases, dephasing on sites 1 and 3 seems worthless, as does relaxation


FMO: most general noise that conserves excitation number?
strictly exciton-destroying noise process? (only include 0 and 1
manifolds in the computation)
engineer a fixed point at sink site by optimizing noise?
polynomial-time incursions to higher excitation manifolds?

Exciton transport with pulsed dephasing


8.2.2012
- uniform fully connected network, n=7: again we get pulsed dephasing on
  initial and final sites to block destructive interference. 30%-unit
  improvement over const dephasing.

3.2.2012
- 3chain with 3 dephasing controls: synchronous sharp spikes on
 "important" sites, broad lobes on nonimportant one


2.2.2012
- assuming spin-1/2 systems from now on
- XX, YY and ZZ all commute
- ZZ is diagonal (real, exciton number preserving!)
- most general two-qubit interaction A which preserves exciton number:
  must have [A, 1*n + n*1] = 0 => A is block-diagonal with block sizes 1,2,1.
  For a Hermitian A the corresponding basis vectors are
  {11, 1Z, Z1, ZZ, XX+YY, XY-YX}

- (XX+YY)/2 = PM+MP, (XY-YX)/2 = i*(PM-MP),  XX+YY gives a real H, XY-YX an imaginary one.

- in the 0+1 manifold a local dephasing operator damps all the
  coherences in which the site is a party.
- preventing a coherence formation also prevents exciton transfer
- (XX+YY:Im or XY-YX:Re part of) coherence is proportional to time derivative of population

- collapsing a coherence stops the transfer, further coherent
  oscillation is limited between the current populations

- moderate constant dephasing:?

- hard pulsed dephasing: "ratchet mechanism" for pop transfer from
  site 1 to 2. Quickly kills the coherence when the direction of the
  pop flow is about to change. Slightly modified by relaxation, 2-3 interaction etc.


9.1.2012
-pulsed dephasing control sequence


21.12.2011
-Successfully replicated spin chain exciton simulation results from Plenio&Huelga
