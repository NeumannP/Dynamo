Changelog for DYNAMO - Quantum Dynamic Optimization Package

+ added
- removed
* changed
b bugfix


1.4.0       in progress
              * docs: User manual expanded and updated.
              * dynamo: Stats system can handle several optimization runs.
                Interrupted runs can be continued automatically.
              * Gradient system simplified. Added gradients using a truncated Taylor series
                with scaling and squaring, and the auxiliary matrix technique.
              + dynamo/gradient_dPdu
              + utils/dPdu_series, utils/dPdu_eig, utils/dPdu_auxmatrix
              - dynamo/error_real
              - dynamo/gradient_full
              - dynamo/gradient_g
              - dynamo/gradient_g_mixed_exact
              - dynamo/gradient_tr
              + dynamo/plot_pop, dynamo/plot_eig: New plotting functions.
              + dynamo/shake: Randomly perturbs the control sequence, can be used to get out of local optima.
              + dynamo/split: Refines the control sequence by splitting given bins into several.
              + test: Unit tests for DYNAMO.
              + test_rand_problem: Generates random optimization problems for testing/benchmarking purposes.
              + test_benchmark: Measures the walltime required to compute different errors and gradients.
              b dynamo/gradient_setup: gradient_g_mixed_exact provided with wrong *_needed_now.
              b dynamo/gradient_g_mixed_exact: gradient with respect to tau was wrong.
