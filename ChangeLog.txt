b bugfix


1.4.0       in progress
              * docs: User manual expanded and updated.
              * dynamo: Stats system can handle several optimization runs.
                Interrupted runs can be continued automatically.
              + dynamo/shake: Randomly perturbs the control sequence, can be used to get out of local optima.
              + dynamo/split: Refines the control sequence by splitting given bins into several.
              + dynamo/gradient_full_exact: Exact gradient using the auxiliary matrix technique.
              + test: Unit tests for DYNAMO.
              b dynamo/gradient_setup: gradient_g_mixed_exact provided with wrong *_needed_now
